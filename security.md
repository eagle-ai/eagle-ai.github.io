* Here you can find information about security updates released for Apache Eagle (incubating, called Eagle in the following). Note that unless specified, no binary or source patches are available. 

* Currently, no significant vulnerability is detected, ad hoc security issues are fixed as the code base grows. Therefore, to obtain a security fix (if any), you need to upgrade to the latest maintained version of Eagle, or file a bug in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/EAGLE) for newly detected ones.

* Sinced created in August 4th, 2016, we will keep this page updated with new security-issue detections and corresponding bug fixes.
