### Security Updates

* Here you can find information about security updates released for Apache Eagle (incubating, called Eagle in the following). Note that unless specified, no binary or source patches are available. 

* Currently, no significant vulnerability is detected, and ad hoc security issues are fixed as the code base grows. Therefore, to obtain a security fix (if any), you may need to upgrade to the latest maintained version of Eagle, or file a bug in ways that follow.

> _Sinced created in August 4th, 2016, we will keep this page updated with new security-issue detections and corresponding bug fixes._

### Reporting Security Problems

* The Apache Software Foundation takes a very active stance in eliminating security problems in its software products. If you have questions about how to configure or use Eagle more securely, you could send them to the [dev mailing list](mailto:dev@eagle.incubator.apache.org). If you find any security problems due to bugs in Eagle software, you could file bugs in the [bug tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/EAGLE). The Apache Software Foundation has a dedicated [security team](http://www.apache.org/security/) which you may contact should the need arise.
